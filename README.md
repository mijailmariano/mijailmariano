## Welcome, I'm Mijail :bowtie:
People & Culture Leader | Data Science | Organizational Psych. 

I am currently a Data Science student in Codeup's Kalpana Cohort. Codeup is a fully-immersive, project-based career accelerator that provides students with 670+ hours of expert instruction in applied data science. 

<span style="color:#2F4F4F"> In my creative time, I enjoy writing, hiking, frisbee golf, and spending as much time with family and our dog as possible. I also lead a bookclub that meets at the intersection of ``leadership and culture``. <br></br>
**I welcome other data science and OrgDev enthusiasts to connect with me and join me on this journey.**</span> :world_map:
